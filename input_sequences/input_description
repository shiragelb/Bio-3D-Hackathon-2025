description of the input files
NESdb_NESpositive_sequences.sv - contaitns sequences extracted from specilized database with experimentally confimed NES
positive Human proteins
Containts: name - name of the protein, species(viral/ Human genome origin) ,NES sequence - identified NES motive in the protein
, full sequence (of the protein) label = 1 i.e positive 

462 positive examples

PDB_Bacteria__Helical_Peptides_NESnegative_sequences.csv
contains: sequences derived from the PDB by searching for alpha-helical peptides from bactrial sources.
full protein sequences and NOT NESS are random 20 amino acid snipets derived from the full sequences.

1856 negative examples

deep_proteomics.csv
contains: 
1027 positive sequences
868 negative sequences

columns: uniprotID, bidining category - relates to enrichment from starting sample in experiment, sequence (full protein sequence) and Enrichment from input.
Enrichment from input - is experimental data that tells us how strong the tested protein binds to CRM-1, in our case higher enrichment means more likly to be POSITIVE.
Note: in non binding (negatives) proteins enrichment is 0 or close to 0 and is expected.

Expectation: the probability of a protein to be positive should corelate to Enrichment from input.
